# Liquid Investigations: OpenVPN Configuration PoC

This repository houses some python scripts to configure OpenVPN. This is to be
integrated with the setup repository, but serves for now as a PoC. It is
inspired by [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-16-04)
tutorial.

To play with this setup, run `vagrant up` in the `Vagrant/` folder.

### Prerequisites

The `Vagrantfile` takes care of all the setup, and installs the following
prerequisites:

 - Ubuntu 16.10
 - git
 - python3-pip
 - OpenVPN
 - easy-rsa
 - virtualenv

It then creates a virtualenv, and installs Python dependencies from
`requirements.txt`

### Scripts

`./generate-server-keys.py`:

This script creates a CA and generates all of the necessary OpenVPN server keys.
It uses some default settings (see the file for details).

TODO: `./configure-openvpn.py`:

This script uses the certs and keys generated by `generate-server-keys.py` and
sets up OpenVPN. See the file for details.

TODO: `./create-client-ovpn.py`:

This script creates an .ovpn file for client use, first creating the necessary
client keys. See the file for details.
